## How its made
Technology used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Github pages, and CDN for html2canvas

HTML: Used to add the basic content such as the title, buttons, and the drawing area.

CSS: Used CSS and flexbox to style the title, buttons, and format how each element should be place on the page. CSS was also used to add animated buttons and small title animations(swaying).

JavaScript: Used JavaScript to add the logic for resizing the drawing array. I also used JavaScript to let the user draw only when their mouse is down.

Github pages: Used to host the landing page.

html2canvas: This captures an html element an allows it be downloaded onto the user's computer. In this case it downloads onto the users downloads folder as a PNG.

## What I learned
- JavaScript Event Handling: I improved my understanding of event listeners and how to handle user/mouse interactions in real time.
- DOM Manipulation: I gained more experience with creating and modifying HTML elements dynamically using JavaScript.
- CSS Flexbox: I deepened my knowledge of flexbox layout techniques such as the wrap property.
- Using CDNs: I learned how to use third-party libraries from a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to have extra functionality like the ability to download a PNG.
