## How its made
Technology used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Github pages, and CDN for html2canvas

HTML: I used HTML to add the basic content such as the title, buttons, and the space the drawing area takes up.

CSS: I used CSS and flexbox to style the title, buttons, and format how each element should be place on the page. I also used CSS to add animated buttons and small title animations(swaying).

JavaScript: I used JavaScript to add the logic for resizing the drawing array. I also used JavaScript to let the user draw only when their mouse is down.

Github pages: Used to host the landing page.

html2canvas: This captures an html element an allows it be downloaded onto the user's computer. In this case it downloads onto the users downloads folder as a PNG.

## What I learned
I learned more on how event listeners and element creation works in JavaScript. I also got more experience with using flexbox and the wrap property to control how elements appear in the drawing area. Lastly, I learned about using CDN and how to import code from online and incorporate it into my webpage.

## Future Features
- Add a way to select more colors
- Add an eraser
