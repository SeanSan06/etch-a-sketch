# Etch-a-Sketch
A pixel drawing web based application that allows the user to resize and choose their brush color.

## How its made
Technology used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Github pages

HTML: I used HTML to add the basic content such as the title, buttons, and the space the drawing area takes up.

CSS: I used CSS and flexbox to style the title, buttons, and format how each element should be place on the page.

JavaScript: I used JavaScript to add the logic for resizing the drawing array.

Github pages: Used to host the landing page.

## What I learned
I learned more on how event listeners and element creation works in JavaScript. I also got more experience with using flexbox and the wrap property.

## Future Features
- Add a way to select more colors
- Add more animations and hover effects
- Add gray scale mode
- Add a way to export to PNG
